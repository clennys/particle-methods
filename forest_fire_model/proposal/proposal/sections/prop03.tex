\section{Agent-based modeling of a multi-room multi-floor building emergency evacuation}
This paper \cite{HA20122740} extends particle-based models to more complex building environments, examining how multi-room and multi-floor architectures affect evacuation dynamics. The authors use the social force model to simulate the movement of agents through realistic building layouts with rooms, hallways, and staircases.
\subsection{Implementation Plan}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Complex Building Geometry Implementation}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Extend the boids framework to implement wall elements and complex floor plans:
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item Create rooms, hallways, staircases, and exits using wall elements
			            \item Implement pedestrian-wall interactions with repulsive forces
			            \item Add capabilities for multi-floor simulations
		            \end{itemize}
		      \item Implement social force interactions between agents:
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item Motivational force (desired direction)
			            \item Psychological repulsive tendency
			            \item Compression forces
			            \item Viscous damping effects
			            \item Sliding friction
		            \end{itemize}
	      \end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Evacuation Scenario Analysis}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Study the effects of:
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item Room door sizes
			            \item Main exit dimensions
			            \item Friction coefficients between pedestrians
			            \item Desired speeds (panic levels)
		            \end{itemize}
		      \item Investigate congestion patterns at doorways and exits
		      \item Analyze the "faster is slower" effect in various building configurations
	      \end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Comparative Analysis}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Compare evacuation dynamics between:
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item Single-room vs. multi-room configurations
			            \item Single-floor vs. multi-floor scenarios
		            \end{itemize}
		      \item Analyze how room door size and main exit dimension interact to affect overall evacuation efficiency
	      \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
