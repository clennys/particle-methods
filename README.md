# Particle Methods and Computational Physics Simulations

**Course:** Particle Methods  
**Institution:** Universit√† della Svizzera italiana (USI)  

A comprehensive collection of particle-based simulation methods for studying complex physical systems, including fire dynamics, ecological interactions, statistical mechanics, and molecular dynamics. This repository contains the practical implementations and coursework for the Particle Methods course at USI.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various particle-based computational methods commonly used in physics, ecology, and materials science. Each simulation demonstrates different aspects of complex systems modeling, from emergent behavior in biological systems to fundamental physics in statistical mechanics. The projects are designed as both educational tools and research-quality implementations for the USI Particle Methods course.
